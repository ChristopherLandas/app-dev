# Black panther (2018)
## I've recently watch this movie; I've been completing the some of the MCU movie I missed before watching the Dr. Strange 2 and the End game
The movie's CG are really good as expected, tho the fight of killmonger and T'Challa at the Vibranium cave are quite cringe since it uses full CG
